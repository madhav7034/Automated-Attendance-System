Face Recognition Based Attendance System

(RetinaFace + ArcFace | Flask | OpenCV)

Project Overview

This project is a Face Recognition Based Attendance System designed to automatically enroll students and mark attendance using facial biometrics.
The system uses computer vision and deep learning models to detect faces, recognize enrolled students, and record attendance accurately and efficiently.

The application includes:

A secure admin panel
Student enrollment with face data
Automated attendance marking using live camera feed
Attendance viewing and CSV export
A modern professional UI with a hover-based sidebar
